--------
Problem:
--------
n number of bottles.
1 of the bottles contain poison.
But the poison will take effect in a month when ingested.
This should take, at best, O(log n) to find the poisonous bottle.

=========
Solution:
=========
DIVIDE AND CONQUER

1. Take each bottle and use binary to label each one.
	eg.
		1st bottle: 00000001
		2nd bottle: 00000010
		3rd bottle: 00000011
		4th bottle: 00000100
		5th bottle: 00000101
		6th bottle: 00000110
		7th bottle: 00000111
		8th bottle: 00001000
		9th bottle: 00001001
		10th bottle: 00001010
		11th bottle: 00001011
		12th bottle: 00001100
		13th bottle: 00001101
		14th bottle: 00001110
		15th bottle: 00001111
		etc.

2. Next, have 1 person take all bottles that have the digit 1 as the far right end of the binary (eg. 00000001) and take a drop from each and pour into a drink.

3. Have another person take all bottles that have the digit 1 as their second to the far right end of the binary (eg. 00000010) and take a drop from each and pour into a drink.

4. Repeat the process until one person take all bottles that have the digit 1 as the first digit on the far left (eg. 10000000) and take a drop from each and pour into a drink.

5. This whole process will take O(log(n)) to distribute and the next step is to have all persons drink their respective bottles. Once a month passes, the persons dead will provide a unique binary which will be the bottle with the poison in it.
